To boost the download speed when using the DNF package manager, 
modify the maximum number of concurrent package downloads in the /etc/dnf/dnf.conf file. By default, 
DNF is set to 3 parallel downloads. Adjusting this to a higher number, such as 10, can significantly 
increase the download speed. After making this change and saving the configuration file, subsequent package 
operations with the DNF command will benefit from faster download speeds.

So open the file using your faviorate editor:

sudo vi /etc/dnf/dnf.conf

Then add the following as shown in the screenshot:

max_parallel_downloads=10

Save and quit.
